I currently work as a Customer Consultant / Cashier in a building society and have done for nealry nine years. I love to help my customers out and maintain good relationships with them over the years. I always provide the best service I can as I pride myself in giving good customer service, it means alot to me. My best qualities are that I am a fast learner, have great organisation skills, I have an excellent telephone manner and I do not shy away from any problems. I am always friendly and try to be as helpful as possible in all situations.<br><br>In administrative fields I think my experience of office applications as well as creative applications helps me in fit in with most computer based environments. I haven't quite found my passion yet but I completely feel it would be in he tech industry I as have always had a yearning for it, but never got the confidence to take it forward.</p>
